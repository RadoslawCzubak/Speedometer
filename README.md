## Overview

The Speedometer App is a mobile application for iOS devices written in Swift. The app provides a speedometer and other crucial informations for cyclists. It allows users to track their current speed while also showing them a map preview of their location and the corresponding coordinates (latitude and longitude).
This application was created because of a **real need** for a simple on-board computer for a 150km route. 


## Features

- Real-time Speedometer: The app uses GPS data to provide users with their current speed in both metric (km/h) and imperial (mph) units.
- Map Preview: Users can view a live map preview of their current location to see where they are and what's around them.
- Coordinates Display: The app displays the current latitude, longitude and altitude of the user's location.
